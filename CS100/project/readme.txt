The games name is 2048

i made it so it works exactly as the actual games

you can move the tiles, or numbers, however way you want.

board sizes to choose from are 4x4, 6x6, 8x8.

if you want to check if the winning scenario works, just pick the 8x8 and keep pressing wasd to quickly get to the number 2048

if you want to check if the losing scenario works, just pick the 4x4 and do the same process since winning on this board is difficult

you can save the game by pressing r. the exact board with its numbers can be loaded when re-running the program

losing the game and re-loading it continues from last-saved checkpoint before you lost
